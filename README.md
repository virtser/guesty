### Demo
https://guesty-home-assignment.herokuapp.com/

### How to
1. `yarn` - to install all project dependencies.
2. `yarn getListings` - to get all listings data into listingsData.json file.
3. `yarn start` - to start the web server which shows the heat map.
4. `yarn deploy` - to deploy the project to Heroku.

### Formula
I choose the following scorring formula: 20% - property rating +  80% - property availablity.

As these are the best paramaters of apartment demand.
